# ShipmentField Magento2 Extension which is compatible  with magento2.3.X
in some cases, when the admin wants to create a new order and he wants to set the shipment rate to Zero, we have to know why? 
in this extension, I've added a new field to the shipment rate section in create a new order from admin form, when you enable this extension 
a new attribute will display in the order grid, and a new field will show up in the create order form as well as in the view order page.
